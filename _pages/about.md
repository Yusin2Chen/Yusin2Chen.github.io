My name is Chen, Yuxing and I am s geospatial data engineer with 7+ years of experience processing SAR and multispectral images. I have expert knowledge in InSAR and self-supervised remote sensing image change detection and data fusion. In addition to my research background, I have proven experience implementing a couple of related projects. Sense, analyze, and act has always been my philosophy in my remote sensing research. Drones are a more active and feasible way to respond to emergencies, difficult situations, and large-area sampling. I have learned a great deal about sensing and analyzing in my undergraduate, master's, and doctoral studies. I am now eager to expand my research to the field of drone action in a postdoctoral position.

I am currently a final year PhD student at the University of Trento, Italy. Before this, I completed my Master's (M.Sc) at the University of Chinese Academy of Science. My PhD focuses on self-supervised remote sensing image change detection and data fusion. Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Geodesy and Geomatics where I focused on InSAR processing.
