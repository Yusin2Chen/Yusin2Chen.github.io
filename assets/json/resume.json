Created a new framework for unsupervised change detection in satellite image time series using contrastive learning with feature tracking.",
"Built a unified model of incomplete multimodal learning for remote sensing data fusion using a random modality combination training strategy and the proposed attention block in network training, as well as the contrastive and reconstruction loss in pre-training, resulting in increased efficiency and accuracy in modal-incomplete inputs.",
"Collected training labels from OpenStreetMap and images from ArcGIS Wayback imagery to train models in large-scale semantic segmentation and change detection tasks, demonstrating a useful and accessible approach.",
"Developed an attention-based deep residual U-shaped network to mitigate atmospheric artefacts in InSAR interferograms, surpassing generic atmospheric correction models and achieving comparable results to advanced time-series InSAR methods.",
